# Quiz_Game

> ### This is a quiz game made for a college project about mythological beings, the game have now its main functions, that means that its now playable, but its not fully completed.

## What we hope to create with this project:

- Create a mini quiz about mythological beings, something close to 10-15 questions with differents levels of difficulty;
- The user will be able to login as a player or as an admin, each one has its own activities;
- There will also have a ranking to track how good the players are going, creating a competition of some kind.

### OBS:

- Before playing in your pc, change the path to this directory inside the code, or else the programn wont work as it should be.
- The files that require changes are: **Ranking_Functions.py** and **__init__.py**, at the bottom of each file. Both of them are inside the Functions directory.
